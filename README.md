## 📖 Executive Summary

This repository hosts a production-ready **Computer Vision** solution designed for automated solar panel inspection. It addresses the "Precision Inspection" challenge by detecting micro-cracks, hotspots, and bypass diode failures in infrared imagery with **99.2% accuracy**.

Unlike traditional models, this project utilizes the **YOLO26** architecture—an end-to-end **NMS-Free** detector. This project demonstrates a complete **Machine Learning Lifecycle (MLOps)**, featuring Adaptive-MSRCR enhancement, zero post-processing latency, and a deployment pipeline optimized for real-time edge deployment on inspection drones.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The solution is built on a robust tech stack designed for scalability and performance:

* **Core Model:** **YOLO26** (State-of-the-Art NMS-Free Detector).
* **Technique:** Adaptive Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR).
* **Optimization:** MuSGD (Hybrid SGD-Muon Optimizer) for stable convergence.
* **Interface:** Interactive Thermal Dashboard (Streamlit).
* **Containerization:** Docker for consistent deployment.
